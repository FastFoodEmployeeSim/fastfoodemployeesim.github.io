          <h2>1. Starting Out</h2>
          <p>To start on your jouney on Fast Food Employee Simulator, simply press <code>play</code> on the title screen. Afterward you will find yourself looking at the day selection screen</p>
          <br>
          <h2>2. Selecting A Day</h2>
          <p>Selecting a day is very easy, all you have to do is click on a day. If you hover over a day, a box with that day's details will show up. Locked days are accessible by comepleteing the day before it.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>3. Working</h2>
          <p>
            Working is one of the essential parts of the game. The different jobs are: 
            <ul>
              <li>Chef</li>
              <li>Janator</li>
              <li>Cashier</li>
              <li>Restocker</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Chef. As a chef you need to make people food. To do that, go to the kitchen and drag and drop the food to the counter. In order to make a full meal you need:
            <ul>
              <li>Fries</li>
              <li>Full Burger (Buns, Steak, and Cheese. You must also cook the steak on the stove)</li>
              <li>Plum Drink</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Then after you have put all those things together on the counter, it will be put in a bag. Then you need to put the bag through the conveyor.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Janator. All you have to do as a janator is clean stuff. Throughout the game epecialy in the later days things will start to become dirty and you must clean them. Things that are dirty will have muddy spots on them. In order to clean press <kbd>C</kbd> near a dirty area (a little popup should appear when you are close enough).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Cashier. Cashier is probably the easiest job, all you have to do is pick up the food from the conveyor and bring it to the counter. Then the customer will pick them up. If you fail to feed the customer in a specific amount of time, you will lose a life; if you lose all three lives you get fired.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Restocker. In the later days food will start to run out and you wont be able to feed the customers. As a restocker you must go outside through the back and carry food into the storage room.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As you progress through the game you might find yourself having to do multiple jobs and more work for each job.</p>
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>4. Progressing</h2>
          <p>The game contains only 1 week. More weeks are added every update. Every week the game get slightly harder the difficulty will increase in 4 ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>More difficult jobs.</li>
            <li>Having more than 1 job at a time.</li>
            <li>Having to feed the customer faster.</li>
            <li>Less lives in a day.</li>
            <li>More complex orders.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The good thing though is that every week you get paid $2 more. So if week one you only get paid $15 per order, then the second week you would get paid $17 per order. The more and more you play, the more of the game's story you will unlock. After each day is a minigame that minigame will help explain some of the game's story. Failing to complete the minigame will not make you get fired.</p>
