          <br>
          <h2>3. Working</h2>
          <p>
            Working is one of the essential parts of the game. The different jobs are: 
            <ul>
              <li>Chef</li>
              <li>Janator</li>
              <li>Cashier</li>
              <li>Restocker</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Chef. As a chef you need to make people food. To do that, go to the kitchen and drag and drop the food to the counter. In order to make a full meal you need:
            <ul>
              <li>Fries</li>
              <li>Full Burger (Buns, Steak, and Cheese. You must also cook the steak on the stove)</li>
              <li>Plum Drink</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Then after you have put all those things together on the counter, it will be put in a bag. Then you need to put the bag through the conveyor.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Janator. All you have to do as a janator is clean stuff. Throughout the game epecialy in the later days things will start to become dirty and you must clean them. Things that are dirty will have muddy spots on them. In order to clean press <kbd>C</kbd> near a dirty area (a little popup should appear when you are close enough).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Cashier. Cashier is probably the easiest job, all you have to do is pick up the food from the conveyor and bring it to the counter. Then the customer will pick them up.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Restocker. In the later days food will start to run out and you wont be able to feed the customers. As a restocker you must go outside through the back and carry food into the storage room.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As you progress through the game you might find yourself having to do multiple jobs and more work for each job.</p>
          </p>
